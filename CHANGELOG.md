  documentation. It now follows the PHP-FIG PSR-12 style.
- [zendframework/zend-coding-standard#22](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-coding-standard/pull/22) refactors
  the ruleset. It uses PSR-12 as the base ruleset with these additional rules:

  - The short open tag SHOULD NOT be used.
  - Deprecated features SHOULD be avoided.
  - The backtick operator MUST NOT be used.
  - The `goto` language construct SHOULD NOT be used.
  - The `global` keyword MUST NOT be used.
  - The constant `PHP_SAPI` SHOULD be used instead of the `php_sapi_name()` 
    function.
  - Aliases SHOULD NOT be used.
  - There MUST NOT be a space before a semicolon. Redundant semicolons SHOULD
    be avoided.
  - Non executable code MUST be removed.
  - There MUST be a single space after language constructs.
  - Parentheses MUST be omitted where possible.
  - PHP function calls MUST be in lowercase.
  - There MAY NOT be any content before the opening tag. Inline HTML in PHP code

    of a line. If multi-line concatenation is used there MUST be an indent of 4 
    spaces.
  - Variable names MUST be declared in camelCase.
  - The short array syntax MUST be used to define arrays.
  - All values in multiline arrays must be indented with 4 spaces.
  - All array values must be followed by a comma, including the last value.
  - There MUST NOT be whitespace around the opening bracket or before the closing 
    bracket when referencing an array.
  - All double arrow symbols MUST be aligned to one space after the longest array
    key.
  - The short list syntax `[...]` SHOULD be used instead of `list(...)`.
  - There MUST be a single space after the namespace keyword and there MAY NOT be
    a space around a namespace separator.
  - Import statements MUST be alphabetically sorted.
  - Unused import statements SHOULD be removed.
  - Fancy group import statements MUST NOT be used.
  - Each import statement MUST be on its own line.
  - Import statement aliases for classes, traits, functions and constants MUST
    be useful, meaning that aliases SHOULD only be used if a class with the same
    name is imported.

  - Trait classes MUST have a `Trait` suffix.
  - For self-reference a class lower-case `self::` MUST be used without spaces 
    around the scope resolution operator.
  - Class name resolution via `::class` MUST be used instead of `__CLASS__`, 
    `get_class()`, `get_class($this)`, `get_called_class()`, `get_parent_class()` 
    and string reference.
  - There MAY NOT be any whitespace around the double colon operator.
  - Unused private methods, constants and properties MUST be removed.
  - Traits MUST be sorted alphabetically.

    `break` SHOULD be used instead.
  - All catch blocks MUST be reachable.
  - There MUST be at least one space on either side of an equals sign used
    to assign a value to a variable. In case of a block of related
    assignments, more spaces MUST be inserted before the equal sign to
    promote readability.
  - There MUST NOT be any white space around the object operator UNLESS
    multilines are used.
  - Loose comparison operators SHOULD NOT be used, use strict comparison
    operators instead. e.g. use `===` instead of `==`.
  - The null coalesce operator SHOULD be used when possible. 
  - Assignment operators SHOULD be used when possible.
  - The `&&` and `||` operators SHOULD be used instead of `and` and `or`.
  - There MUST be one whitespace after a type casting operator.
  - There MUST be one whitespace after unary not.
  - Inherited variables passed via `use` MUST be used in closures.
  - Code SHOULD be written so it explains itself. DocBlocks and comments

    _Created by_, _getter_ and _setter_, MUST NOT be used in comments.
  - The `@var` tag MAY be used in inline comments to document the _Type_
    of properties. Single-line property comments with a `@var` tag SHOULD
    be written as one-liners. The `@var` MAY NOT be used for constants.
  - The correct tag case of PHPDocs and PHPUnit tags MUST be used.
  - Inline DocComments MAY be used at the end of the line, with at least a
    single space preceding. Inline DocComments MUST NOT be placed after curly 
    brackets.
