        // There MUST NOT be a space after the opening parenthesis.
        //
        // There MUST NOT be a space before the closing parenthesis.
        //
        // There MUST be one space between the closing parenthesis and the
        // opening brace.
        //
        // The structure body MUST be indented once.
        //
        // The body MUST be on the next line after the opening brace.
        //
        // The closing brace MUST be on the next line after the body.
        //
        // The body of each structure MUST be enclosed by braces. This
        // standardizes how the structures look and reduces the likelihood of
        // introducing errors as new lines get added to the body.
